To compile the code, unzip to a directory of a machine that has the GCC toolchain and make installed.  After that, just run the command make in the directory.  It should output an executable named "measure."

To run measure, type "sudo ./measure NNNN" where NNNN is the number of iterations.  If you don't have sudo privileges, you will need to manually comment out the system configuration line in main.c and rebuild.

Note: the software expects certain files to be in the directory while it's running.  For instance, it expects a file called bigfile in the directory.  It also expects files 1.bin - 20.bin in the directory.  These files are used for the thread contention measurement.  The last file that is expected is a network file.  To run for your particular system, you will need to either create these files are change the code and recompile.  Thanks.
