To compile the code, unzip to a directory of a machine that has the GCC toolchain and make installed.  After that, just run the command make in the directory.  It should output an executable named "measure."

To run measure, type "sudo ./measure NNNN" where NNNN is the number of iterations.  If you don't have sudo privileges, you will need to manually comment out the system configuration line in main.c and rebuild.
