TaintDroid
----------

ARM dominates the mobile market instead of Intel.

Enabling and simplifying the reuse of components

Dalvik virtual machine
- providing environment on which every android application runs
- executing the dalvik executable (.dex)
		.java => .class => .dex

Relying on Linux Kernel 2.6 for core system services
- memory and process management
- network stack
- driver model
- security

Providing an abstracton layer between the H/W and the rest of the S/W stack

How does taint-tracking work?
1) Identifies sensitive data
2) Taints and tracks data flow via
- variables, messages, methods, and files
3) Monitors behaviour of running applications in realtime
4) Identifies misuse of private data

TaintDroid is a system-wide integration of taint tracking into the Android platform
- variable tracking throughout Dalvik VM environment
- patches state after native method invocation
- extends tracking between applications and to storage
