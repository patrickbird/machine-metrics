Xen and the Art of Virtualization
---------------------------------

When VmWare first started
- their market positioning: allow you to run linux on windowws or vice versa

But what helped them make a lot of money?

EMC acquired VmWare for 625 millions in 2004, and then offered 15-20% of VmWare to public (now still owns 80% of Vmware)
- VmWare Market cap today: $35 billion

At SOSP'03, peaker was asked how Xen relates to L4.  Surprisingily, the speaker responded that the didn't know about it....

VMMs were a hot OS research topic in the 2000s

The name is a play on the book title "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"  While writing the book he wrote computer manuals as his day job.

Note that some aspects of the design of Xen as described in this paper have changed.

What cntribution does this paper make?
- high-performance VMM that supports strict resource control among guest OSes


************   What is the difference between virtualization and paravirtualization?  ******************

Requirements
------------
- isolation among virtual machines -- untrusted users
- heterogenous operating systems simultaneously
	- hetergeneous applications and environments
- minimal performance overheard
	- low cost of virtualization
	- Ousterhout: 'virtual' is just another way of saying 'slow'
	- early Cray supercomputers did not have virtual memory because Cray did not want to add overhead of virtual to physical translation
- strict resource accounting
	- want folks to pay for resources (higher-evel goals of computational grid)
- limited mods to guest OSes -- minimize porting overhead
- no change to applciation binary interface (ABI) -- no porting of apps
- scale to 100 operating system intances
	- more not needed by apps
