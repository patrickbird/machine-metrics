A Fast File System for UNIX
---------------------------

Seek time is a problem

Problems
- Random data block placement in aging file system
- Inodes allocated far from data blocks
- Low bandwidth utilization
- Small max file size
- Waste from large block size
- Recovery
- Device oblivious

Solutions
- allocate data in same file close together (Cylinder groups)
- inodes and data close together
- larger block size (1024 to 4096)
- larger block size (w/4096, only need two levels of indirection to reach 2^32)
- fragments (different sizes)
- replicated superblocks (superblocks not placed in same track to minimize effect of platter failures)

FFS has a two-level allocator, global and local.  What does the global allocator try to achieve?
- localize related data within a cylinder group (e.g. all inodes for a directory in same cyl group)
- distribute unrelated data across cylinder groups (e.g. new directories placed in cyl group with >avg #inodes)


What does the local allocator try to achieve?
- opitmal local placement
	- rotationally optimal block in same cylinder
	- block in same cyl group
	- search through cyl groups

What is one requirement of the new FFS?
- requires a minimum of free space so that cul block allocations can be done: 10%
- this is why you will see some file systems with >100% utilization


Log-structured FS
-----------------

What is the main point of this paper?
- file system designed to exploit h/w and workload trends

What are these trends?
- disk b/w is scaling, but latency is not
- large main memories
	- large file buffer caches
	- absorb a greater fraction of read requests
	- use for write buffers as well
	- coalesce small writes into large writes
- workloads
	- small file access
- LFS spawned a vocal controversy between Ousterhout and Seltzer about whether LFS was better than an extent-based FFS
- The main complaint was that cleaning required too much overhead, and that it was a source of hidden costs.
- The issue has never been settled definitely, although most file system today are extent-based FFS rather than LFS.

Journaling file system is like a hybrid between log and extent based systems
